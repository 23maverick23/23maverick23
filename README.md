### ðŸ‘‹ Ryan's GitHub Profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan Morrissey and I'm a technical pre-sales manager at a large software company. Programming and web design are hobbies of mine, and I use Github to share the work I do with others in the event it's helpful. I'm not an expert in any particular area, but I love learning new concepts and keeping current on technology trends.

- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently working on re-documenting my Project Euler solutions from 10 years ago in Python (math is hard)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about OAuth2.0 for a new API endpoint at work
- ðŸ§° Outside of tech, I'm continuing to teach myself woodworking and wood joinery
