### ðŸ‘‹ Ryan's GitHub Profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan Morrissey and I'm a technical pre-sales director at a large software company. Programming and web design are hobbies of mine, and I use Github to share the work I do with others in the event it's helpful. I'm not an expert in any particular area, but I love learning new concepts and keeping current on technology trends.
